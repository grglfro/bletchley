Bletchley Installation Guide
============================

Bletchley is developed under Debian, but is likely to work on most
modern Linux distributions, *BSD and MacOS.  Windows is not yet
supported, but may be in the future.


Dependencies
------------
* Python 3.x, plus the distutils package (python3-distutils under Debian)
* scons (available as a package in most Linux distributions)
* gcc
* Optional: python "requests" library (python3-requests under Debian)


Installing
----------
For the forseeable future, don't try to use a release version, since those 
aren't up to date.  Check out the latest with:
 $ svn co https://code.blindspotsecurity.com/dav/bletchley

Then from the "trunk" directory, build it by running:
 $ scons

And as root, install with:
 # scons install

Want to update to a newer version?  
Just run 'svn update' and as root, 'scons install'.
